# Routing

The route system is based on the following conventions and rules:

::file-tree{name=routes}
  ::tree-folder{name=sub-route}
    :tree-file[_index.ts]
    :tree-file[_middleware.ts]
    :tree-file[_fallback.ts]
    :tree-file[_ignored.ts]
    :tree-file[sub-sub-route.ts]
  ::
  :tree-file[_index.ts]
  :tree-file[_middleware.ts]
  :tree-file[_fallback.ts]
  :tree-file[_ignored.ts]
::

## Conventions and rules

### `_index.ts`

This will take the parent route and set itself as leaf.

The following tree will create a ***conflict*** at the router resolve:
::file-tree{name=routes}
  ::tree-folder{name=sub}
    :tree-file[_index.ts]
  ::
  :tree-file[sub.ts]
::

### `_middleware.ts`

This will make a middleware in the route context.
