# Introduction

Densky (pronounced `Denski`) is the backend framework for Deno. A backend framework is
an opinionated and complete workspace made to simplify all of the common problems and 
needs of the backend developers.

## Installation

For now the only way to install densky-cli is from [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html), the package manager for Rust, but we are **working on a script** to install it without compile or install other things like Rust. You can see Densky entry page [here](https://crates.io/crates/densky).

```bash [Cargo]
cargo install densky
```

## Create a new project

1. Start a new Densky project with:

```bash
densky init <folder-name>
```

2. Run the `dev` command to start Densky in development mode:

```bash
densky dev
```

::alert{type="success"}
âœ¨ Well done! You should open for <http://localhost:3000> in your browser
