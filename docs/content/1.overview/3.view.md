# Make a view

The Densky's views system is very primitive but has the needed things.

That things are the dynamic generation on the server, known as **SSR** (Server Side Rendering).

# Simple view

To create a view just add a file at `src/views`, in this case the name isn't import, so use anything valid for your the file system.

```html [src/views/index.html]
<html>
    <head>
        <title> My example API </title>
        <!-- ðŸš§ Working on static files -->
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/style.css" />
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1> Hello World </h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

Now you need to edit the route where you want to see it.

```ts [routes/_index.ts]
import { HTTPResponse } from "densky";

export async function GET() {
    return await HTTPResponse.view("index");
}
```

## Dynamic view

This is so simple, just add an eval inside `{ }` and all the magic will be done it by Densky.

To use a dynamic view its equal.

::code-group
```html [views/user.html]
<html>
    <head>
        <title> My example API </title>
        <!-- ðŸš§ Working on static files -->
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/style.css" />
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1> User info </h1>
        <h2> ID: { data.userId } </h2>
    </body>
</html>
```


```ts [routes/user/$id.ts]
import { type HTTPRequest, HTTPResponse } from "densky";

export function GET(req: HTTPRequest) {
    return await HTTPResponse.view("user", {
        userId: req.params.get("id")
    });
}
```
